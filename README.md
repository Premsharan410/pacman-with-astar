## 🎮 Features

- Playable Pac-Man with smooth grid-based movement  
- Four ghost enemies with different colors and behaviors  
- A* pathfinding logic for intelligent ghost chasing  
- Interactive home/start screen with animations  
- Score tracking and win/lose conditions  
- Clean UI with restart option

## 🧠 AI Logic (A* Pathfinding)

The ghosts use the **A\*** (A-Star) algorithm implemented in `astar.py` to find the optimal path to Pac-Man:

- Each ghost **recalculates its path periodically**.  
- The path **avoids walls and obstacles**.  
- Different ghost modes (**chase**, **ambush**, **random**, **patrol**) can be easily extended.  

📘 The A\* logic prioritizes nodes with the lowest **(cost + heuristic)** using **Manhattan distance** for pathfinding.
